    "You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.\n",

    "\n",
    "Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.\n",

    "Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]\n",
    "\n",

    "Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.\n",
