    "Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1:\n",

    "Input: x = 121\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: true\n",

    "\n",
    "Input: x = -121\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: false\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: x = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: false\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.\n",
