    "'.' Matches any single character.\n",

    "# First accepted solution. This one was written with significant assistance, particularly from this video:\n",
    "# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAA8mgxlov8\n",
    "# I was able to get the brute force method down but I was unsure how to optimize it for runtime. This video helped me out\n",
    "# by not only showing me how to restructure my brute force to make it more amenable for caching, but also showing me how to\n",
    "# combine caching and recursion to reduce runtime. \n",
    "\n",
    "# In terms of explaining this problem and its solution, you would probably be better served watching the video linked above rather\n",
    "# than reading my ramblings. However, here is my very simplified explanation for why this solution works:\n",
    "\n",
    "# So, to start with, we can see that the problem we have can be reduced down to a binary tree of decisions.\n",
    "# To see this, we need two pointers that will keep track of where we are in the input string and pattern respectively. We will\n",
    "# call these 'i' and 'y', where i tracks the input string and y tracks the input pattern. If we begin at i = 0 and y = 0 respectively,\n",
    "# we can use incrementation and if statements to check (in a binary fashion) whether the sequence of characters we encounter in \n",
    "# the input string match the sequence of characters we encounter in the input pattern according to the rules set by the problem \n",
    "# description. Now it becomes a question of exactly when we want to increment each pointer respectively, and what kind of if \n",
    "# statements we want to use. We will find that asterisks, as defined by the problem, and whether or not we will utilize them to \n",
    "# expression match, are pertinent to deciding these.\n",
    "\n",
    "# We want to use asterisks in places where having multiple of the preceding input_pattern character is necessary to match the input\n",
    "# string. That is, we're saying that the input_string character at position i matches the input_pattern character at position y.\n",
    "# Moreover, the next input_pattern character (aka at position y+1) is an asterisk, and the next input_string character at position\n",
    "# i+1 is the same as the input_string character at position i. For example, aa and a*, where input_string[i = 0] and \n",
    "# input_string[i = 1] both equal input_pattern[y = 0], and input_pattern[y = 1] is an asterisk '*'. \n",
    "# As you can see, we start out with i and y both being the same character.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In these cases, we want to increment i by 1 and y by none up until the point at which we no longer need to use * to achieve\n",
    "# expression matching, that is, up until i becomes a different character than y. At that point, we just increment i by none and \n",
    "# y by 2, thereby skipping over the asterisk's position in the input_pattern, and staying at our current position in input_string \n",
    "# (where the current position is the one we have reached after having incremented until reaching a character different than its\n",
    "# preceding one).\n",
    "\n",
    "# For example, let's use the input string ac and the input pattern a*c.\n",
    "\n",
    "# i = 0, y = 0\n",
    "# ac   a*c\n",
    "# i    y\n",
    "\n",
    "# string[i] == pattern[y], and pattern[y+1] == '*'\n",
    "# thus, i +=1\n",
    "\n",
    "# i = 1, y = 0\n",
    "# ac   a*c\n",
    "#  i   y\n",
    "\n",
    "# string[i] != pattern[y] and pattern[y+1] == '*'\n",
    "# thus, y +=2\n",

    "# i = 1, y = 2\n",
    "# ac   a*c\n",
    "#  i     y\n",
