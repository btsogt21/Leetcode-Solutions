    "\n",
    "Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '\\*' where:\n",
    "\n",
    "'.' Matches any single character.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\\*\" Matches zero or more of the preceding element.\n",
    "\n",
    "The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"aa\", p = \"a\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: false\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: \"a\" does not match the entire string \"aa\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"aa\", p = \"a*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: true\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: '\\*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes \"aa\".\n",

    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"ab\", p = \".\\*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: true\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: \".\\*\" means \"zero or more (\\*) of any character (.)\"."
