    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a string s and an array of strings words of the same length. Return all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once, in any order, and without any intervening characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can return the answer in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"barfoothefoobarman\", words = [\"foo\",\"bar\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: [0,9]\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are \"barfoo\" and \"foobar\" respectively.\n",
    "The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"wordgoodgoodgoodbestword\", words = [\"word\",\"good\",\"best\",\"word\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: []\n",

    "## Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"barfoofoobarthefoobarman\", words = [\"bar\",\"foo\",\"the\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: [6,9,12]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 <= s.length <= 104\n",
    "s consists of lower-case English letters.\n",
    "1 <= words.length <= 5000\n",
