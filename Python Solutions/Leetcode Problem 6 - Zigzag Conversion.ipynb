    "# First accepted solution. This one was written without assistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# I thought up of this particular solution after considering the relationship between the number of rows inputted and the number\n",
    "# of times we must increment through the input string to reach the same 'zig-zag' position we start from. I found that the\n",
    "# number of times we must increment through the input string to reach the same position as before is defined by the number of\n",
    "# rows inputted as such:\n",
    "# increment = 2*numRows - 2\n",
    "\n",
    "# This increment calculation allows us to handle the first and last rows in any given zig-zag structure, and is instrumental\n",
    "# in allowing us to handle all rows in between. Let us consider 'Example 2' above. We have four rows present, row0, row1, row2,\n",
    "# and row3. Let's start at index 0 of the input string, 'P', which also happens to be the first letter in row0, and increment\n",
    "# by 2*numRows-2. We are now at the 6th index of the input string, 'I', which happens to be the second letter in row0. If we \n",
    "# increment again, we reach the last letter in row0, 'N'. At this point, if we try to increment again, we will hit an 'index\n",
    "# out of bounds' error, which will tell us that we need to move onto row1 (in the code itself, we avoid encountering this error\n",
    "# by utilizing the 'range' function to define an end boundary past which we will not be incrementing).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now, let us say we have moved onto the next row, row1. We start at index 1, 'A', which also happens to be the first letter in row1,\n",
    "# and we increment by 2*numRows-2. We are now at index 7, 'S', which is the same position within the current 'zigzag' as index 1.\n",
    "# However, it is the third letter within row1, which means we have skipped over one letter. In order to get back to this letter\n",
    "# we have skipped, we can just decrement by 2 positions, reaching index 5, 'L'. This pattern holds regardless of which 'zig-zag'\n",
    "# you are currently on. For example, say we are at index 7, 'S'. From here, we just increment by 2*numRows-2, and decrement by 2\n",
    "# positions to reach the letter that is in between index 7 and 13 but in the same row. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Let us apply this to row2, the other row that is not the first or the last row. Let's say we start at index 2, 'Y', which happens\n",
    "# to be the first letter in row2. If we increment by 2*numRows-1, we reach index 8, 'H', which is the third letter in row2. We \n",
    "# have skipped over the second letter in row2, and to get back to it, we must decrement by 4 positions. Doing so, we reach index 4,\n",
    "# 'A', which happens to be the second letter in row2.\n",
    "\n",
    "# You may have noticed that the number by which we must decrement after incrementing in order to not skip over any of the letters\n",
    "# within a given non-last/non-first row is 2 * (rowIndex). For example, in order to reach the second letter of row1, we started at \n",
    "# the first letter of row 1 (index 1 of the input string), incremented by 2*numRows-2, and decremented by 2*(rowIndex) where\n",
    "# rowIndex = 1 since we are on row1. That is, we start at the first letter of any given row that is not the first or last row\n",
    "# (where the index of the first letter for a given row happens to always be the same as that row's index), add (2*numRows-2*rowIndex-2) \n",
    "# to it's index, and we have reached the index of the second letter within that given row. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Given the above mechanisms, we can now convert an input string into its 'zig-zagged' counterpart given the number of rows.\n",
    "# We first check for edge cases, particularly cases where numRows == 1, or numRows> len(s). In both of these cases, we just return\n",
    "# the input string itself since the 'zigzag' transformation won't actually change the order in which we output the string components.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Then, we go about defining a range to hold our row indices (range(numRows)), and then we define another range that holds the \n",
    "# indexes of all letters in a given row that are in the same 'zig-zag' positions (range(i, len(s), 2*numRows-2), where 'i' is\n",
    "# the current row that we are on and 's' is the input string). The first will allow us to iterate through each row, whereas the second\n",
    "# will allow us to maneuver within said row so as to retrieve letters within that row in left to right order. However, the second,\n",
    "# as it currently is, lacks the 'decrement' factor we discussed earlier, and can therefore only be utilized to handle the first\n",
    "# and last rows within the 'zigzagged' input string. As you can see in the code below, we implemented the 'decrement' factor so that\n",
    "# for the non-first/non-last rows, we are able to account for letters that fall in between two subsequent index positions within\n",
    "# the current iteration of the second range. Basically, say we are at the first letter of row1 (which is the second row since row0\n",
    "# is the first row), which is index 1 of the input string. By incrementing by 2*numRows-2, we reach index 7 which is the next letter\n",
    "# at the same position in the next zig zag as the current letter. However, because we have a zig zag structure, every time \n",
    "# we increment to reach the next letter at the same position in the next zig zag while in a non-first/non-last row, we are skipping\n",
    "# over one of the letters inside the given row, which, although not in the exact same position of the zig-zag as the first letter,\n",
    "# still exists within the row we are currently examining. This is why we must include a decrement factor which allows us to \n",
    "# access that 'lost in the middle' letter prior to incrementing our index in the second range to move onto the\n",
    "# next letter that occupies the same position in the zig-zag structure as our current index. \n",
